It is a great pleasure for me to express my respect and deep sense of gratitude to my M.Tech supervisor \textbf{Dr. Narottam Chand Kaushal}, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science \& Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, for his wisdom, vision, expertise, guidance, enthusiastic involvement during the course of my M.Tech. at NIT Hamirpur. I am specially indebted to him for teaching me both writing and research skills which have proven to be beneficial for my current research and future career. Without his endless efforts, knowledge and patience this research would not have been possible. It has been a great honor and pleasure for me to do research under his supervision.\\
\par I would also like to extend my special thanks to all the teachers and staff members of \textbf{CSE Department and Computer Centre} for their timely help and cooperation extended throughout the course of investigation.\\

\par I am obliged to my parents for their moral support, love, encouragement and blessings to complete this task. Without their dedication and dependability I could not have accomplished this task.\\


\par Finally, I am indebted and grateful to the Almighty for helping me in this endeavor.\
